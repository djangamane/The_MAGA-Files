## What Still Needs to Be Done

### 1. Supabase Setup
- Create a Supabase project
- Set up the database tables using the provided schema
- Configure authentication settings using the authentication guide
- Add environment variables to your deployment environment

### 2. Email Service Integration
- Integrate with an actual email service provider (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
- Implement the `sendAnalysisEmail` function in `emailService.ts`

### 3. Payment Processing
- Integrate with a payment processor (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- Implement the `processOneTimePayment` function in `paymentService.ts`
- Add webhook handlers for payment confirmation

### 4. Environment Variables
- Add the following environment variables to your deployment environment:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### 5. Testing
- Test the free tier limit functionality
- Test the payment flow
- Test the email functionality (after implementation)
- Test user authentication and session management

## How to Deploy

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Run the database schema SQL commands
3. Configure authentication using the provided guide
4. Add the required environment variables to your Vercel project settings
5. Deploy the application to Vercel

## Monetization Strategy

The implementation supports two tiers:
1. **Free Tier**: 3 queries per day
2. **Paid Tier** ($10 one-time): Unlimited queries and email delivery of analysis results

This approach allows you to:
- Capture users with a low barrier to entry
- Monetize power users with a one-time purchase
- Provide value through email delivery of analysis results
